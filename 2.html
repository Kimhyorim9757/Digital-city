<strong>Analog signals</strong> are continuous. Therefore, if noise is introduced from the surrounding area, only noise cannot be removed.

On the other hand, <strong>digital is made up of 0,1 only</strong>.There's a little noise coming in around.You can restore it to its original state even if you do so. So it's strong against noise, and it's reliable.

Secondly, digital can be compressed by encoding. The CD is not compressed, so one music is 20 to 30 Mbyte, but if you compress it into MP3, you can reduce it to 2 to 3 Mbyte.

The frequency band of the previous analog TV and the current digital TV we use is the same as 6Mhz.But for analog TVs, the resolution is SD (640 x 480), while for today's digital TVs it's Full HD (1080 x 768), almost four times better.
