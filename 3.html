<P>
The disadvantage of digital signal processing is that the existing signal is not fully contained because it is quantified by dividing it into a finite number of samples, which can be solved by increasing the sampling rate, but taking more samples is not exactly the same as the existing signal.
In addition, insufficient sampling causes <strong>a frequency overlap</strong>.
